  \begin{Problem}
    Let $\mata$ and $\matb$ be symmetric positive-definite matrices in
    $\R^{n\times n}$. Let there be constants $c_1,c_2$ such that
    \begin{gather*}
      c_1 \vx^T\mata\vx \leq \vx^T\matb\vx \leq c_2 \vx^T\mata\vx.
    \end{gather*}
    Derive an estimate for the convergence of the conjugate gradient
    iteration for $\mata\vx=\vb$ with preconditioner $\matb^{-1}$
    depending on $c_1$ and $c_2$.

    \textit{Hints:} Lemma 2.3.80 in the lecture notes, and Thereom
    1.2.5 (note, that the definition of the Rayleigh quotient is
    independent of the choice of the inner product).
  \end{Problem}

  \begin{Problem}
    Consider again the 2D Laplace operator $\matl_2$, discretized by
    the five-point-stencel, as in \cref{sheet7:problem4} on
    \cref{sheet7}.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Implement a method that computes the smallest eigenvalue of
      $\matl_2$ using the inverse iteration (Algorithm 1.3.6 in the
      lecture notes).  Do not calculate the invers explicitely for
      solving the appearing linear system, but use the conjugate
      gradient iteration (Algorithm 2.3.57 in the lecture notes) for
      this matter.
    \item Use your implementation to calculate the smallest eigenvalue
      of $\matl_2$ for $n~=~50$ and $n=100$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{Problem}
