  \begin{Problem}
  	Problem 1.2.5 in the Lecture Notes.
  \end{Problem}

  \begin{Problem}
	Problem 1.2.7 in the Lecture Notes.
  \end{Problem}

  \begin{Problem}
	Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix
	\begin{gather*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cos(\alpha) & \sin(\alpha) \\
	-\sin(\alpha) & \cos(\alpha)
	\end{bmatrix},
	\end{gather*}
	for $\alpha\in\R$.
  \end{Problem}

  \begin{Problem}
  	Given a normal matrix $A$ and a right eigenvector $v$ of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.
  	Show that then the complex conjugate of $v$, $\bar{v}$, is a left eigenvector of $A$ with the same eigenvalue $\lambda$, i.e.
  	\begin{equation*}
  	v^{\ast} A = \lambda v^{\ast}.
  	\end{equation*}
  \end{Problem}
