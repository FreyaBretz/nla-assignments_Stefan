\begin{Problem}
	Use your implementation of the Conjugate Gradient Method (Problem 3 on Sheet 9) and 
  	augment it such that you can compute the eigenvalues of the projected matrix $\matH_m$ in each step.
  	For the computation of the eigenvalues you could, for example, use your implementation of the QR iteration (Problem 3 on Sheet 5).
  	Test your implementation with $\matl_2$ as in Problem 3 on Sheet 9 and observe the convergence of extremal eigenvalues $\lambda_{\text{min}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{max}}$.
\end{Problem}
  
	\begin{Problem}
		Show that GMRES and Arnoldi with modified Gram-Schmidt will convwerge on the linear system $\mata\vx = \vb$ when
		\begin{gather*}
			\mata = 
			\begin{pmatrix}
				&&&&1\\
				1&&&&\\
				&1&&&\\
				&&1&&\\
				&&&1&
			\end{pmatrix},
			\quad
			\vb = 
			\begin{pmatrix}
				1\\ 0\\ 0 \\ 0\\ 0\\
			\end{pmatrix},
		\end{gather*}
		and $\vx_0 = \boldsymbol 0$.
