  \begin{Problem}
	  ~\\[-\baselineskip]
	  \begin{enumerate}
		\item Write a function \texttt{Compute\_Givens} which takes two values $a$ and $b$ and returns the Givens parameters $c$ and $s$.
		\item Write a function \texttt{Apply\_Givens\_left} which applies a Givens rotation (matrix) from the left to a matrix $M$.
		\item Test the functions by computing and applying the Givens rotation to pairs of values from the vector $x=(10,\ldots,1)^T$ beginning with the last two entries and ending with the first two entries, 
			thereby transforming the vector into a multiple of the first unit vector.
		\item Apply the same computation to randomly generated vectors (which you find in the template file).
	\end{enumerate}
