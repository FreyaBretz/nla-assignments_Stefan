	\begin{Problem}
		Consider a matrix of the form 
		\[\mata = \identity + \alpha\matb, \]
		where $\matb$ is skew symmetric (real), i.e., such that $\matb^T = -\matb$.
		\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
			\item Show that $\langle\mata\vx,\vx\rangle/\langle\vx,\vx\rangle = 1$ for all $\vx \neq 0$.
			\item Consider the Arnoldi process for $\mata$. 
				Show that the resulting Hessenberg matrix will have the following tridiagonal form:
				\[ \matH_m = \begin{pmatrix}
					1 & -\eta_2 & & & \\
					\eta_2 & 1 & -\eta_3 & & \\
					  &  & \cdots & & \\
					  &  & \eta_{m-1} & 1 & -\eta_m \\
					  &  &  & \eta_m & 1 
				\end{pmatrix}.\]
			\item Using the result of part (b), explain why the CG algorithm applied as is to a linear system with the matrix $\mata$, which is nonsymmetric,
				will still yield residual vectors that are orthogonal to each other.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{Problem}

	\begin{Problem}
		Consider the CG Method described in Algorithm 3.4.31.
		Assume, in line 4, $\langle \mata\vp_m,\vp_m\rangle = 0$ and thus the algorithm terminates there.
		Why is the Krylov space $K_m$ invariant?
		Why have we found the exact solution then?
	\end{Problem}

\begin{Problem}
	Consider again matrix $\matt_{\alpha}$ as introduced in \cref{sheet7:problem3}} on sheet \cref{sheet7}.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Implement a method that computes the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix 
		$\matl_2$ using the inverse iteration (Algorithm 2.6.2 in the
		lecture notes). Do not calculate the inverse explicitly for
		solving the appearing linear system, but use the conjugate
		gradient iteration (Algorithm 3.4.31 in the lecture notes) for
		this matter.
		\item Use your implementation to calculate the smallest eigenvalue
		of $\matl_2$ with $n=20$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{Problem}
