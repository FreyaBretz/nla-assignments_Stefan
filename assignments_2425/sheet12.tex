  \begin{Problem}
	  Let $\mata$ and $\matb$ be symmetric positive-definite matrices in $\R^{n\times n}$.
	  Let there be constants $c_1,c_2$ auch that 
	  \begin{gather*}
		  c_1 \vx^T\mata\vx \leq \vx^T\matb\vx \leq c_2 \vx^T\mata\vx.
	  \end{gather*}
	  Derive an estimate for the convergence of the conjugate gradient iteration for $\mata\vx=\vb$ with preconditioner $\matb^{-1}$ depending on $c_1$ and $c_2$.

	  \textit{Hints:} Lemma 3.4.72 in the lecture notes and Theorem 2.2.17 (note that the definition of the Rayleigh quotient is independent of the choice of inner product).

  \end{Problem}
  
  \begin{Problem}
    Develop a modified version of the non-Hermitian Lanczos algorithm
    that produces a sequence of vectors $\vv_i$ ,$\vw_i$ that are such
    that each $\vv_i$ is orthogonal to every $\vw_j$ with $j\neq i$
    and $\norm{\vv_i}=\norm{\vw_i}=1$ for all $i$.
  \end{Problem}

	\begin{Problem}
		Find an example of a matrix with a real spectrum for which the QR method will not converge to an upper triangular matrix.
